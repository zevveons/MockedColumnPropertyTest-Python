ðŸ”” A lightweight system for tracking property changes and notifying containers in real time that i made in Py for Columns! ðŸ””


âœ… Unit Testing: Uses Pythonâ€™s unittest framework properly with clean, focused test cases.

âœ… Input Validation: Carefully checks for valid inputs (like non-null property IDs and correct types), avoiding silent failures.

âœ… Database Row Modeling: Like a mini ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system

âœ… Data Validation and Integrity Enforcement:

âœ… Prototype and Rapid Development Skills:
